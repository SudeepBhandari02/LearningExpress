# 🚀 My Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Learning Journey

Hi there! 👋  
This repository documents my learning journey as I dive into the world of **backend development** using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.

---

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- **Node.js**: Understanding asynchronous programming, modules, and building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Learning to build RESTful APIs, middleware concepts, and routing.
- **MongoDB**: Working with NoSQL databases, CRUD operations, Mongoose ORM for structured data modeling.

---

## 📅 Timeline

| Week | Topics Covered |
|:----:|:---------------|
| 1 | Basics of Node.js: modules, fs, http, events |
| 2 | Express.js: routes, middleware, error handling |
| 3 | MongoDB Basics: CRUD operations, MongoDB shell, Compass |
| 4 | Mongoose: schemas, models, connecting MongoDB with Express |
| 5 | Building mini-projects: Notes API, Book Manager , Notes App api |
| 6 | Authentication & Authorization: JWT, password hashing |
| 7 | Deployment: Deploying apps to Render, Vercel |

---

## 🛠️ Projects I Built

- **Simple Notes API** (Node + Express + MongoDB)
- **Book Manager API** (MongoDB CRUD)
- **Authentication System** (JWT-based authentication)
- **Small Practice APIs** (testing different Express and MongoDB features)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Mastered

- Setting up Express servers
- Building and connecting MongoDB databases
- REST API fundamentals (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Error handling and validation
- Using environment variables with `dotenv`
- Structuring backend projects properly
- Securing routes with authentication
- Deployment basics

---

## 📈 What's Next

- Dive deeper into advanced MongoDB (aggregation, indexing)
- Learn about WebSockets for real-time communication
- Start learning TypeScript with Node.js
- Explore GraphQL APIs
- Build a full-stack MERN project 🚀

---

## ✨ Reflections

Learning backend development has been an exciting journey so far.  
Every project I build makes my understanding stronger.  
I realize that **small consistent efforts** are better than rushing through big concepts.
